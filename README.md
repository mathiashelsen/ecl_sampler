ecl_sampler
===========

A sampling plugin driven by ECL logic

The idea is that a diode bridge can be pulsed on for a very short time (~50ps) through the use of 
an avalanche transtistor and step recovery diode. 


The use of ECL enables a digitally controllable delay line to vary the position of the sample point to the trigger point.
